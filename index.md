The DMSE Breakerspace welcomes MIT undergraduates to explore the world of materials through hands-on experiences with powerful desktop materials characterization instruments. More than just a laboratory, it’s a dynamic hub for multidisciplinary learning, encouraging students to pursue their own questions. The Breakerspace also features a lounge for relaxing, socializing, and enjoying espresso — an inclusive space for academic exploration and leisure.

## Training and access:

**Open to All Undergraduates:** Regardless of your major or interests, Breakerspace welcomes all MIT undergraduates. Whether you’re a biologist, philosopher, or an economics major, satisfy your curiosity about the materials that make up the world—or just come in, make an espresso, and relax.
