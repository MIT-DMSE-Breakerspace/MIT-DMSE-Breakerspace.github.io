## 3.000 Coffee Matters: Using the Breakerspace to Make the Perfect Cup

<img src="../assets/img/3000.JPG" alt="3.000 logo" style="width:33%; float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:1.4em;"> Uses the Course 3 (DMSE) Breakerspace to delve into the world of materials science through brewing, sipping, and testing several forms of coffee and espresso. Presents cutting-edge materials characterization tools, including optical and electron microscopes, spectroscopy techniques, and hardness/strength testing. Through experiments to analyze the composition and microstructure of coffee beans, grinds, and brewing equipment, students have the opportunity to learn how material properties influence the taste, aroma, and quality of espresso. Equips students with the knowledge and skills to appreciate coffee on a whole new level through application of materials characterization techniques, consideration of relevant physics and chemistry, and sampling. Subject can count toward the 6-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first-year students.
