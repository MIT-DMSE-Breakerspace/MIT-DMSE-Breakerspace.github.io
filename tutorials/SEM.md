#### Live Feed

When moving the camera around the sample, use the arrow keys for big jumps. Press control and the arrow keys for more precise movement, or click to center the camera on your cursor. To focus click the focus button in the bottom left corner. The brightness and magnification buttons are right above it. Right click the focus and brightness buttons to toggle between manual and auto adjustment. Right click and drag for precise adjustments and use the mouse wheel for large adjustments.

#### Live EDS

Click on the Live EDS icon in the top left. Click anywhere on the live feed to see the elemental makeup of that section by atomic and weight concentration. Click the square to stop data collection before navigating to a different section.


* Materials
	* compatible materials
		* Powders
		* Solids
	* sample prep
	* safety/handling related info

* Common failure modes
	* If you can't get the instrument to transition to SEM imaging, take your sample out and put it back in.

	* Before navigating away from an EDS make sure that it isn’t active or else the instrument might lock itself in place. Go back to the EDS and start and stop it again to fix.

	* If you have a brittle sample, you may have to use a low voltage and beam intensity to prevent damage.





* Manufacturer manuals
	* software manual
	* hardware manual
* Links
	* good video tutorials, etc.
* Exercises
	* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
	* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
	* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
