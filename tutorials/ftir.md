### <a name="overview"></a> Overview:

The Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer provides an infrared spectrum of absorption or transmission of a solid, liquid, or gas, for identification, primarily, of organic or polymeric materials. This tutorial focuses primarily on use of the instrument with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory, which allows for easy sampling of materials in solid, semi-solid, powder, paste, and liquid forms. The user guide for the spectrometer hardware can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rfba0x3swuhi4affsytv6/2638_iS5-UG.pdf?rlkey=mnjpwg72rbau8dsaw8jwg9flk&dl=0).

The software used to operate the iS5 is called OMNIC. This [_Getting Started_](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nhx1fk2ov5fpkz4og1guf/2640_OMNIC_GS.pdf?rlkey=93wld38wdscvv94o177jylilu&dl=0) guide has a useful list of tutorials and instructions on how to access them from within the software.

The full set of anufacturer's manuals and other training materials can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/n0zv4090ncohz1yd53zyp/AEk8_3vo2JuCcHDSDBEEjck?rlkey=haqbguq12kbmh8fi7jmi8wzvg&dl=0).

### <a name="startup"></a> Instrument startup:

The power indicator is a blue light on the left side if the instrument. If not lit, switch on the instrument with the switch on the left-rear of the instrument.
