# Thermofisher Phenom Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM)

## Overview

The Breakerspace has two scanning electron microscopes (SEM), a ThermoFisher [Phenom XL](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/desktop-scanning-electron-microscopes/phenom-xl.html) and [Phenom Pure](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/desktop-scanning-electron-microscopes/phenom-pure.html). 

[SEMs](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/what-is-sem-scanning-electron-microscopy-explained/) use a focused beam of electrons to image materials at much higher magnification than can be achieved with an optical microscope, with our instruments able to resolve features as small as 100 nm in optimum conditions. 

Our Phenom XL has a large 100x100 mm sample stage, a low vacuum mode for non-conducting samples, can perform [energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/edx-analysis-with-sem-how-does-it-work/), and also has a [tensile stage](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/MSD/Flyers/desktop-sem-tensile-sample-holder-FL0116.pdf) for in-situ observation of mechanical experiments. The Phenom Pure can observe a single sample on an 18 mm or smaller stub, under either low or high vacuum, and has a cold-stage for observation of frozen samples. Both instruments have [backscatter (BSD) and secondary electron (SED) detectors](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/sem-signal-types-electrons-and-the-information-they-provide/).

<a name="prep"></a>
#### Sample prep basics:

* Prepare samples externally on the sample prep table
* Firmly attach samples to stub
* Remove loose debris with compressed air

#### Solid sample prep (basic):

* Place a bare sample stub in a sample prep tray
* Attach a double-sided carbon pad to the stub
* Attach the sample to the pad
* Blow sample with compressed air to make sure it is well attached and there are no loose particles
* For an expanded discussion of sample prep techniques, see page 15 of [the manual](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iyd538gtkj79kg0bc8113/2020-MS-Phenom-XL_User-Manual.pdf?rlkey=0yk985nvgz3lckqnrtxwo7afv&dl=0)

#### Powder sample prep (basic):

* Place a bare sample stub in a sample prep tray
* Attach a double-sided carbon pad to the stub
* Use a spatula or similar to pick up a small amount of sample and transfer it to the carbon pad with a gentle flick - the goal is to spread grains as evenly as possible, and keep make sure there is no more than a single layer on the pad
* Blow sample with canned air to make sure everything is well attached and there are no loose particles

#### Wet sample prep:
If your sample is wet, you need to dehydrate it or freeze it. This is because, when under a vaccum, liquid water in your sample will gas off and cause damage. 

##### How to dehydrate your sample:
* Place your sample in the [sputter coater](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/sputter_coater.jpeg).
* Click mode until you reach the [drying mode](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/sutter_coater_drying_setting.jpeg). Set drying time and start. 

##### How to freeze your sample using the cold stage:
* Check if the [water box](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_refilling_water.jpeg) needs refilling. The cover can be screwed off with a 2 mm Allen wrench. 
* Attach your sample to a metal stud with [cryo-embedding compound](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_cryo_embedding_fluid.jpeg)
* Insert metal stud into cold stage. Use a 1.5 mm allen wrench to [adjust the height](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_adjusting_sample_height.jpeg) until the top of your sample is just below the edge of the sample holder. 
* Insert the [connector block](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_gif_putting_in_connector.gif) into SEM.
* Turn on cold stage, by [switching on the main unit](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_on_switch.jpeg) and then clicking auto on the  [controller](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_achieving_minus20C.jpeg).
* Wait until the stage reaches the goal temperature (usually -20C). The glue will turn [opaque](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/cold_stage_frozen_sample.jpeg) once frozen. If your sample is thick, wait a little longer until the top of your sample is frozen. However, if you wait too long, your sample may become covered in ice crystals from condensation.
* Lift sample holder from the stand and insert into the SEM. Tuck the black wire connecting to the sample holder under the edge of the SEM divider
* Once finished, remove the sample holder from the SEM. Then, click off on the controller. Once the stage has returned to room temperature, turn off the main unit with the on-off switch.

#### Sample conductivity and sputter coating:

Samples that are not electrically conductive will "charge" if observed under high vacuum mode. With no path to ground, electrons will build up on the sample surface, and the negative charge will repel electrons from the beam back up to the detector, making the image slowly glow white - this is called charging. Mild charging may also cause the image to distort or creep, as the accumulated electrons on the sample steer the electron beam. 

There are two strategies to mitigate charging effects:

1. Operate the microscope in "low" vacuum mode. In this mode, some ionized gas molecules remain in the chamber and are able to lift charge away from the surface. Pros to using low vacuum mode are no additional sample prep, which makes it a non-destructive method to image non-conductive samples. Cons are lower resolution/lower magnification than can be achieved with conductive samples, and the SED is not available.
2. Sputter coat your sample with gold in the [sputter coater](../assets/img/tutorials/sem/sputter_coater.jpeg) in [coating mode](assets/img/tutorials/sem/sputter_coater_gold_setting.jpeg).
3. Hold your sample down with a lot of copper tape.

### Detailed operating instructions: 

<a name="loading"></a>
#### Sample loading:

* Remove sample stage from the microscope (or drawer for _Phenom Pure_)
* _Phenom XL:_ sample compartment is opened by pressing eject button in the software
* _Phenom Pure:_ sample compartment is manually opened and closed, but must be unlocked with the eject button in the software
* Using stub tweezers, push pin on stub into a hole in the sample stage
* _Phenom Pure:_ black stage sets instrument in high vacuum mode, gray stage sets instrument in low vacuum mode for charge reduction on non-conducting samples
* Set proper sample height
* _Phenom XL:_ set the tallest part of your tallest sample level with the opening of the sample stage, then lower by 6 notches on the dial
* _Phenom Pure:_ the tallest part of the sample should be just lower than the top edge of the sample stage
* Load the sample stage into the instrument
* Close the door and your sample should be visible in the NavCam

<a name="data"></a> 
#### Characterization:

__Customize:__ When your sample is loading, this is a good time to visit [Settings/Customize](../assets/img/tutorials/SEM/customizer.PNG) and change the _Label_ and _Location_ fields to a name and folder that are relevant to your project

__NavCam:__ When you first load a sample into the SEM you see your sample(s) on the [NavCam](../assets/img/tutorials/SEM/navcam.PNG). This is an optical image of the sample stage that can be used for navigation once you are in SEM observation mode. If you will rely on the NavCam image for navigating your sample(s), it is helpful at this stage to make sure the brightness, contrast, and focus are all acceptable in key areas of your sample. If you wish, you can click the camera icon in the NavCam to save the NavCam image to a file.

__LiveSEM view:__ Once you click "Move to SEM" __add image__ you will be in the LiveSEM view. Here you can adjust brightness, contrast, and focus, as well as changing magnification. The recommended UI setup is to leave the scroll wheel set to change magnfication, hold down the right mouse button and move the mouse cursor horizontally to change focus, and to use auto brightness/contrast. A full set of keyboard and mouse shortcuts can be found in [Settings/Phenom/Help](../assets/img/tutorials/SEM/shortcuts.PNG). Detailed operating instructions and a full UI overview can be found starting on page 20 of either the [_XL_](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iyd538gtkj79kg0bc8113/2020-MS-Phenom-XL_User-Manual.pdf?rlkey=0yk985nvgz3lckqnrtxwo7afv&dl=0) or [_Pure_](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7ju8ldfdm0p04m6n81men/Phenom-ProX-G6-User-Manual.pdf?rlkey=l6gg1ld4zpmtxgrsxfgw00jpb&dl=0) manual.

__Gallery:__ The gallery will show you all images in the active folder. In addition to reviewing the images, you can add dimensions and notes. If you annotate the images the annotated versions need to be saved as new files.

__Acquisition:__ Press the camera icon on the left side of the screen to acquire an image. Images will be saved in the resolution and with the averaging specified in the Operational Settings/Acquisition menu. Pay attention to acquisition times, and take some test images first. Higher averaging settings swill increase signal to noise, and result in cleaner images, but longer acquisition times. If there are issues related to charging, such as drift, they will be more visible in longer acquisitions, so higher averaging is not always better or needed. 

__EDS:__ [Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/edx-analysis-with-sem-how-does-it-work/), available on the _Phenom XL_, allows you to perform elemental analysis and save out full reports, included map images, images and data of captured spectrum, and a CSV files with raw data. Recommended settings for EDS are 15kV acceleration voltage and map beam intensity. Click the square to stop data collection before navigating to a different section.

__Live EDS:__ Live EDS mode, (_Phenom XL only_) lets you perform quick elemental analysis on a spot on your sample, without generating any files or documentation. It is useful for quick spot checks. Recommended settings for EDS are 15kV acceleration voltage and map beam intensity. Click the square to stop data collection before navigating to a different section.

<a name="unloading"></a>
#### Sample unloading:

* Open the sample compartment
* Remove sample(s)
* _Phenom XL:_ return sample stage to sample compartment, close door
* _Phenom Pure:_ close door, place sample stage in drawer


<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* _Phenom XL:_ If the SEM fails to start press the eject button to open and close the door and reinitialize the sample loading process
* _Phenom XL:_ In either live EDS or EDS, if you do not press the stop button, and attempt to return to observation mode, you will get an error message, and need to return to where you were and press stop **add image/gif**
* Sensitive samples may experience [degredation](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/materials-science/learning-center/applications/sample-degradation-scanning-electron-microscope-sem.html), often in the form of cracks on the surface, or the sample may appear to be melting or boiling. Lowering acceleration voltage, beam intensity, and magnification will all help slow the rate of degredation.
* EDS low or no counts: check working distance is between 4 mm and 7 mm, and if not, adjust stage height to correct working distance into this range. Also verify acceleration voltage is 15kV and beam intensity is set to map
