### Standard operating protocol:

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup:

* Log on to the instrument workstation using your MIT kerberos
* Open the Bluehill Universal software
* If the event log opens up, you can click close. 

<a name="operation"></a>
#### Operation: 

* Set up your mechanical test set up. See the [detailed operation instruction](#details) for how to set up different types of samples.
* Ensure the correct load cell connector[ADD IMAGE] is inserted. 
* Click Method[ADD IMAGE]. Here you can create your own method by choosing a template or look at preexisting methods.
* Click Home button[ADD IMAGE], then click Test. From here, you can run a crude "QuickTest" or choose from any method.
* Set travel limits[ADD IMAGE] to prevent the head from bumping into anything.
* Once on the testing page, press unlock then go on the hand controller to start testing.
* The test will end once sample snaps. To stop the test before that, you can press stop on the hand controller[ADD IMAGE] or the red emergency stop button[ADD IMAGE] 

<a name="shutdown"></a>
####  Instrument shut down:

* Save your data using the save button[ADD IMAGE].
* Disassemble your testing set up. Return all parts to the boxes they came from.
* Wipe up any debris.
* Close the Bluehill Universal software and log off the computer.
* Ensure the Instron is in disabled mode[ADD IMAGE]

### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* Avoid samples which may shatter dangerously, i.e. glass.
* Avoid wet samples or anything that would get the machine too dirty.
* Some samples may need cutting to fit into the machine grips. The Breakerspace has scissors, razor blades, and a sectioning saw available.
* It may be good to google if there is an ASTM standard for you specific test.

### Detailed operating instructions: 
The Instron can do tensile, compressive, and flexure testing. Each test needs different grips. 

* To start all set ups, you need to choose your load cell, 50 kN or 5 kN for smaller, weaker samples.
	* The 50 kN cell always stays attached to the machine.
 	* To install the 5 kN cell, pull it up 

#### Tensile Ttsting



#### Compressive testing



#### Flexure testing

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>
### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* these are where people frequently get stuck
* example may include starting DSX software before microscope powered up
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="manuals"></a>
### Manufacturer's manuals:

* Links to manual files in dropbox

<a name="links"></a>
### Links:

* list of links, ie. good video tutorials, some student project, anything relevant

<a name="exercises"></a>
### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
