# Instron 68TM-50 Universal Testing System

## Overview:

The Breakerspace's Instron is equipped with 50 kN and 5 kN load cells, with fixtures for tensile, compression, and flexure testing.

### Standard operating protocol:

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup:

* Log on to the instrument workstation using your MIT kerberos
* Open the Bluehill Universal software
* If the event log opens up, you can click close. 

<a name="operation"></a>
#### Operation: 

* Set up your mechanical test set up. See the [detailed operation instruction](#details) for how to set up different types of samples.
* Ensure the correct load cell connector[ADD IMAGE] is inserted. 
* Click Method[ADD IMAGE]. Here you can create your own method by choosing a template or look at preexisting methods.
* Click Home button[ADD IMAGE], then click Test. From here, you can run a crude "QuickTest" or choose from any method.
* Set travel limits[ADD IMAGE] to prevent the head from bumping into anything.
* Once on the testing page, press unlock then go on the hand controller to start testing.
* The test will end once sample snaps. To stop the test before that, you can press stop on the hand controller[ADD IMAGE] or the red emergency stop button[ADD IMAGE]

<a name="shutdown"></a>
####  Instrument shut down:

* Save your data using the save button[ADD IMAGE].
* Disassemble your testing set up. Return all parts to the boxes they came from.
* Wipe up any debris.
* Close the Bluehill Universal software and log off the computer.
* Ensure the Instron is in disabled mode[ADD IMAGE]

### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

* Avoid samples which may shatter dangerously, i.e. glass.
* Avoid wet samples or anything that would get the machine too dirty.
* Some samples may need cutting to fit into the machine grips. The Breakerspace has scissors, razor blades, and a sectioning saw available.
* It may be good to google if there is an ASTM standard for you specific test.

### Detailed operating instructions: 
The Instron can do tensile, compressive, and flexure testing. Each test needs different grips. 

* To start all set ups, you need to choose your load cell, 50 kN or 5 kN for smaller, weaker samples.
	* The 50 kN cell always stays attached to the machine.
 	* To install the 5 kN cell, insert the thin end of the 5 kN cell into the bottom of the 50 kN cell. Insert a clevis pin through the two, then attach a safety clip. See here[ADD IMAGE] for an example.
  	* Rotate the metal ring[ADD IMAGE] right until tight.
  	* If using the 5 kN cell, it is crucial to plug the 5 kN load cell connector[ADD IMAGE] into the side of the machine[ADD IMAGE].
* All parts will be attached in a simular fashion. Align the internal holes and insert a clevis pin. Then add a safety clip and rotate the metal ring to secure.
	* Use a spanner wrench[ADD IMAGE] to tighten the metal rings if necessary. 
* Follow these diagrams to learn generic set-ups for tensile, compressive, and flexure testing. If you mix and match parts, make sure they can all handle the force you'll apply to them.
	* Tensile testing with 5 kN head
 	* Tensile testing with 50 kN head
	* Compressive testing with 5 kN head
 	* Flexure testing
 
#### Video extensometer
* Click the on button[ADD IMAGE]

<a name="data"></a>
### Data processing and analysis:

* By default the software will output a force versus displacement graph.
* When creating a method you can ask the software to automatically calculate a lot of properties for you[ADD IMAGE].

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* Unless the red light of the video extensometer appears, the video extensometer is not on. Try pressing the on button again.  
* Plugging in the load cell connector is difficult and may take multiple tries. One common mistake is forgetting to to push in the side clips[ADD IMAGE] when inserting it. 
* On the hand controller, if the buttons are not responding to you, try pressing unlock. [ADD IMAGE]. This will get the machine out of disabled mode and into set up mode, where you can move the head.

### Exercises:

* Beginner: Set up a 50 kN tensile testing set up, load a sample, and run it. You should see the sample's force-displacement curve appear.
* Advanced: Use the video extensometer to have the machine measure strain.
