# Breakerspace XRD Tutorial

## Overview:

Use our [Panalytical Aeris Research XRD](https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/products/product-range/aeris-range) ([X-ray diffractometer](https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/products/technology/xray-analysis/x-ray-diffraction)) to analyze properties such as phase composition, crystal structure, and orientation of solid samples, with precise results in less than five minutes.

<a name="sop"></a>
### Standard operating protocol: 

<a name="startup"></a> 
#### Instrument startup: 

* Make sure at least [one position in the sample changer is free](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/sample-changer.JPG) (no sample holder in place)
* Turn the mains power switch at the rear of the instrument
* Make sure that the cover is closed
* [Press the power button to switch on the instrument](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/power-button.JPG)
* Turn the [HT keyswitch](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/keyswitch.JPG) to switch on the HT generator


<a name="operation"></a>
#### Operation: 

* Prepare your sample externally at the sample prep table
* Put the sample holder in a loading position on the sample changer
* Select a measurement program from the drop-down list
* Put in a descriptive sample name
* Start the measurement
* Export results to networked workstation or USB drive
* Fill out your information in the X-ray safety log book
* Repeat as needed - additional samples can be loaded and added to the queue while current sample is being measured

<a name="shutdown"></a>
####  Instrument shut down:

* Press the Power button to switch off the instrument
* Turn the HT Keyswitch counter-clockwise to switch off the HT generator
* If the instrument will be switched off for a long period of time, you can also switch off the mains power supply

<a name="materials"></a> 
### Compatible materials and sample prep: 

The Aeris has a Cu _Kα_ with penetration on the order of 100 µm. For powder samples, grain size should be on the order of 5-10 µm to ensure sufficient grains of various compounds contribute to the reflection of the beam. This source will cause fluorescence in samples with iron and manganese, and may not provide suitable results for samples with those elements.

Panalytical provides an excellent sample preparation guide, available in paper form in the lab and [here in pdf form](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/17o43bqhe52u49kkecvrf/xrd-sample-holders-preparation.pdf?rlkey=vxi65kwyeqrcr62jbcxa5rqvq&dl=0), please refer to it for instructions on use of the sample holders and sample prep techniques

Page 1.4 lists all the various types of sample holders that can be obtained. Of those, we have:

* PW1811/00 and PW1811/27 for back or front loading of powders
* PW1812/00 for odd shapes (fixed with plasticine or wax)
* PW1813/26 for metal plates, membrane filters, pressed pellets, etc.


<a name="details"></a> 
### Detailed operating instructions: 

* include sample loading/unloading
* as needed explanations of each step, eg. collecting background, sample loading, etc.
* software features
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="data"></a>
### Data processing and analysis:

* what softare we recommend
* typical steps
* fill in with more detail as time allows, and/or add standalone data processing tutorials
* images/videos inline as needed

<a name="failures"></a>
### Common failure modes:

* Booting the instrument with all sample changer positions occupied will result in a somewhat [opaquely worded error](../assets/img/tutorials/xrd/sample-changer-full.JPG)

### Exercises:

* intro for anyone - eg honey bee on optical
* beginner exercise for course 3 subjects - identify and measure types of grain in metal sample, 
* advanced exercise - deconvolution of compound sample from spectrometer, etc.
